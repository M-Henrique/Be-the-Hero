## About the Project
  NGOs (Non Governamental Organizations) exist all over the World. With different occupation areas, they serve a vital purpose in modern society, helping with noble causes 
without putting profit first. Problem is, may of those organizations do not have the financial resources required in order to exercise their duty, depending on donations to fullfill their missions.
That's where Be the Hero comes in, functioning as a bridge between the NGOs in need of resources and the people (heroes) determined to help with their own money and/or kind words, providing detailed descriptions of cases and means of helping them.
